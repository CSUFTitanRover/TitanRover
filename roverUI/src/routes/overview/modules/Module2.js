                    I wonder... I wonder, if there in your mind,
                    Do you still remember that moment behind?
                    That singular second; that instant of then;
                    When everything stopped, and the world changed again?
                    I wonder... I wonder, if there in your dreams,
                    Is everything different or still as it seems?
                    Do you ever pause to consider the Earth?
                    Do you ever ask what security's worth?
                    I wonder... I wonder, if there in your world,
                    Has empathy, wisdom, or hatred uncurled?
                    Are you more distrustful, or do you recall:
                    United we stand, but divided we fall?
                    Remember, whatever your future may be,
                    I hope that that it's happy and healthy and free.
                    Remember to love, and to laugh, and to give.
                    Remember September 11th, and live.
