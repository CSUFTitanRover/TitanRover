# Inverse Kinematics

The purpose of this feature branch is to attempt to implement inverse kinematics for our 6 DOF Robotic Arm.

Goals:

1) Implement IK for 2 DOF first for our 2 main joints
2) After IK for 2 DOF works then implement 3 DOF for our 2 main joints & our elbow joint
3) Get IK to work with our graphical representation for our arm.
