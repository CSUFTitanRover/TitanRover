# Robotic Arm UI 

This will be my playground for creating and implementing a graphical representation of our 6 DOF robotic arm. The GUI will be interactive and will reflect changes made to the physical arm. So that means if the arm is moved via joystick then the GUI arm will also move the same way.

Goals:
    
    1. Create a GUI without any interactivity.

    2. Implement 1-to-1 interactive control for each joint

    3. Implement IK interactive control for the robotic arm


Notes:

    - I plan to do this in JS using either <canvas> or <svg>
    - I'm going to attempt to start this project using KonvaJS and ReactJS
    - Once I can test and see that it works well only then will I incorporate the arm GUI inside the Mission Control UI. (So for this GUI will be just a plain page with only the arm GUI).
    - If things don't play well than I will make a standalone arm GUI that we can have running on the side during our missions.
